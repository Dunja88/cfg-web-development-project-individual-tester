    Locally referred to as the Pearl of the Dolomites and situated in the South
    Tyrol region of northern Italy, Lago di Braies (Pragser Wildsee) is a UNESCO
    World Heritage site famous for its emerald waters, endearing boat house,
    fragrant spruce pines forests and towering limestone peaks. Due to the
    Italian TV series Un passo da cielo the lake has only become more popular,
    attracting the attention of domestic and international tourists alike.
    46.6943° N, 12.0854° E From Bolzano you can take the train to Villabassa
    (Niederdorf) and from there catch the local bus 442 to the lake for €3.
    Although this lake can be visited all year round, if you’re coming via
    public transportation, it is worth noting that the local bus only runs
    seasonally from June 20th to September 20th.
